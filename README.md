Javascipt based of vegetation of trees using expression. Evolution Crops is a project intended to demonstrate machine learning techniques in evolution using an algorithm developed by the Department of Bioinformatics at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. To visualize we used WebGL with parametric trees. The project is still under development.
